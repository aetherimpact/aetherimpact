20, they/he, taken, en/fr

often idling off-tab or afk. if i seem unresponsive, whisper me if you need something or want to interact! most of the time im totally ok with people sitting with me or striking up a convo :>


*if my nametag says...*

tc = touch comfort = feel free to sit with me, snuggle me, etc! it'd make me happy <3

xt = not talkative = i dont have the energy to talk much right now, but i still like company. come chill in silence with me or use me as ur void to shout into if you want!

dni = do not interact = i rather be left alone right now. people very close to me are exempt from this!


*note:* i love meeting new people (especially sourcemates) but im so bad at talking, seriously if i seem uninterested or like im ignoring you theres a 99.9% chance i just dont know what to say or im feeling shy ;^; im sorry
