### *aether !!*

20, they/he, taken, en/fr

often idling off-tab or afk. if i seem unresponsive, whisper me! ill probably notice eventually!!

most of the time im totally ok with people sitting with me or striking up a convo, as long as we share a fandom! i also love just hanging out near others even if we dont talk. cuddles are fine! feel free to come keep me company! 
the only time im not up to interacting with strangers is if im with my boyfriend or my friends, or if my displayname says otherwise. 

my main comfort characters are venti, zhongli, tartaglia, and lumine. seeing ponies of them makes my day <3

*note:* i love meeting new people (especially sourcemates) but im so bad at talking, seriously if i seem uninterested or like im ignoring you theres a 99.9% chance i just dont know what to say or im feeling shy ;^; im sorry
