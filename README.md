### *aether !!*

20, they/he, taken, en/fr

often idling off-tab or afk. if i seem unresponsive, whisper me! ill probably notice eventually!!

sometimes i accidentally emote while trying to switch tabs, i promise im not randomly smooching u on purpose LOL

most of the time im totally ok with people sitting with me or striking up a convo! i also love just hanging out near others even if we dont talk. big touch comfort! feel free to come keep me company! the only time im not up to interacting with strangers is if im with my boyfriend or my friends, or if my displayname says otherwise.

*note:* i love meeting new people (especially sourcemates) but im so bad at talking, seriously if i seem uninterested or like im ignoring you theres a 99.9% chance i just dont know what to say or im feeling shy ;^; im sorry
